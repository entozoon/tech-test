# Tech Test

## Installation

    npm install

## Run the server and app

    npm start

## Development

During development of the front end, start the server with:

    npm run serve

And simultaneously, let the front end compile by running:

    npm run compile

To build the project for the production server, run:

    npm run build

## Run Tests

Unit tests are set up to notice very basic hangups to show the concept, rather than pick up issues exhaustively.

    npm test
